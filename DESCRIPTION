Description: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintain
    a portal <http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html> for
    accessing state, regional and national influenza statistics as well as
    mortality surveillance data. The web interface makes it difficult and
    time-consuming to select and retrieve influenza data. Tools are provided 
    to access the data provided by the portal's underlying API.

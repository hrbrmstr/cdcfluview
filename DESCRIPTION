Description: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) maintains a portal
    <http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html> for
    accessing state, regional and national influenza statistics as well as
    Mortality Surveillance Data. The Flash interface makes it difficult and 
    time-consuming to select and retrieve influenza data. This package 
    provides functions to access the data provided by the portal's underlying API.
